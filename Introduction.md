# What is a data structure?

A *data structure* is a way of organizing data so it can be used **effectiveky**.

# Abstract data type?

An *abstract data type* is an abstraction of a structure which provides only the interface to which the structure must adhere. There are no specific implementation details. It's looking at data from a higher level without having a coding language or concrete implementation in mind.

# Computational complexity Analysis

How much *time* and *space* my program uses. We use *Big-O Notation* or the worst case scenario to describe the efficiency.

+ constant time: O(1)
+ logarithmic time: O(logn)
+ linear time: O(n)
+ quadratic time: O(n^^2)
+ exponential time: O(a^^n) with a > 1

Big-O analysis only cares about big inputs, so constants and smaller exponents are less important so they are mostly ignored.
